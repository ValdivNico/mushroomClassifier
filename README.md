# Project Title: Mushroom Classification using Decision Trees

this is a small project to classify mushroom between poisonous and edible with a decision tree. The decision tree is produced using the ID3 algorithm.  

The .py file includes function for importing and preparing the data. The data set was cleansed already. The methods work well with any categorical data. The tree implementation was design for categorical data - so far. Train and test .csv files are a random sample without replacement of the original data (mushrooms.csv). The training-test dataset size ratio is 8:2.
